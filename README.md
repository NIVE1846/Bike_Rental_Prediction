# Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction Project  

This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand for a bike-sharing startup using machine learning models and data analysis. By understanding key factors that influence demand, the company can optimize bike availability, reduce shortages, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Description  

Bike-sharing services often face challenges due to fluctuating demand. This project leverages a publicly available dataset to analyze bike rental patterns, identify trends, and build predictive models. Insights derived from the analysis guide decision-making for inventory management and strategic planning.

## Features of the Project  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.  
   - Graphs to highlight trends, such as rentals by hour and rentals vs. temperature.  

2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Built models using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**.  
   - Evaluated model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  

3. **Visualization and Reporting**:  
   - Created clear and engaging visualizations to present insights.  
   - Developed dashboards to make the results more accessible and actionable.  

4. **Recommendations**:  
   - Provided strategies on when to scale up bike availability based on predicted demand.

## Dataset  

The dataset includes hourly data on bike rentals along with associated weather and time features.  

**Key features include:**  
- `temp`: Normalized temperature.  
- `hum`: Normalized humidity.  
- `hr`: Hour of the day.  
- `holiday`: Whether the day is a holiday or not.  
- `cnt`: Total bike rentals.  

---

## Key Insights  

- Rental demand peaks during specific hours of the day and varies with temperature and season.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** provided better prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.  
- Strategic recommendations were made to address high-demand periods and optimize bike inventory.
