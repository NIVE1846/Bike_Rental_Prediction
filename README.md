Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling project for a bike-sharing startup. The goal is to forecast bike rental demand based on factors like weather conditions, season, and time of day. The insights aim to help the company optimize bike availability and improve customer satisfaction.

Project Overview
The bike-sharing business faces fluctuating rental demands, often leading to either shortages or excess inventory. To address this issue, this project utilizes a publicly available dataset to build predictive models and provide actionable insights.

Key objectives include:

Data Analysis: Understanding rental trends and patterns.
Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning models to predict demand.
Visualization: Creating engaging and insightful graphs.
Recommendations: Providing strategies for better bike availability.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about hourly bike rentals, weather conditions, and time-related features.

Key features include:

temp: Normalized temperature.
hum: Normalized humidity.
hr: Hour of the day.
season: Seasonal information (spring, summer, fall, winter).
cnt: Total bike rentals.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Correlation heatmaps.
Visualizations for rental patterns by hour and temperature.
Model Building:

Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluated models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization and Reporting:

Created dashboards to present insights.
Compared actual vs. predicted rentals using visual plots.
Key Visualizations
Correlation Heatmap: Identifies relationships between features.
Bike Rentals by Hour: Shows peak rental times.
Rentals vs. Temperature: Highlights how temperature impacts demand.
Actual vs. Predicted Rentals: Compares model predictions with actual data.
Results
Random Forest Regressor outperformed Linear Regression in prediction accuracy.
Recommendations provided for scaling bike availability during high-demand hours.
Future Work
Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms.
Incorporate real-time data for dynamic prediction.
Enhance dashboards for better user interaction
